Regent Private Wealth is Winnipeg â€˜s leading private wealth management company. Located in downtown Winnipeg, the company serves many wealthy individuals as well as mass affluent clients.

The economics team is responsible for setting capital market expectations of various assets classes as well as forecasting various macroeconomic indicators. Interest rates are one of the primary indicators that the team predicts.

Below are the interest rate projected scenarios for the year:

High - which implies interest rate is projected to be 20%

Medium - which implies interest rate is projected to be 10%

Low - which implies interest rate is projected to be 8%

The team also came up with projected growth rate scenarios for the year:

High - which implies growth rate is projected to be 7.5%

Medium - which implies growth rate is projected to be 5%

Low - which implies growth rate is projected to be 2.5%

Based on the interest rate and growth projections, the value of a stock is estimated using the following formula:

P = D / (R - G)

Where:

R is projected interest rate - this rate should be in percentages expressed as decimals

G is projected growth rate - this rate should be in percentages expressed as decimals

D is the most recent dividend - should be integer greater than 0 but less than 100

Based on the price, the team then calculates the projected market value using the following formula:

MV = P * S Where

P is price

S is number of shares

As a data scientist, you have been hired to create a program that will take as inputs Projected interest rate level - high, medium, low. Projected growth level of the stock - high, medium, low

Most recent dividend - must be an integer greater than 0.

Number of shares - must be an integer greater than 0 And returns the projected market value for the investment.
